# ReinforcementLearning
Random RL projects I've been working on. This REPO just work-in-progress files mostly for backup

## Projects: <br />
__Mario DQN via CNN__: DQNspeedyboiRevamped.ipynb (great name, I know)(works decently after a lot of optimization. Still needs more training time...) <br />
__Chrome Dinosaur game__: dino.py Use  MSS to capture the screen. Use pip-keyboard automation for control.<br />

## Projects using TF-agents:  <br />
__PPO__: agents-ppo.ipynb (used this to try and solve gym-carracing. No luck. Probably need more training time/hyperparameter tuning :(  <br />
__SAC__: agents-ppo.ipynb (same problem...)  <br />

## Future:   <br />
__Snake game__: out in the far future <br />
__Some sort of physical game__. No clue what. Will need to use a more sample efficient algo due to real world correlation. Maybe Actor critic etc...
